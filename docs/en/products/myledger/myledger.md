[![Download on the App Store](https://toolbox.marketingtools.apple.com/api/v2/badges/download-on-the-app-store/black/en-us?releaseDate=1754870400 "Download on the App Store")](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gnucash-helper-manage-money/id6738621485?itscg=30200&itsct=apps_box_badge&mttnsubad=6738621485)

MyLedger is a GnuCash mobile app, which is a personal financial accounting app.
			
MyLedger is a companion mobile app for GnuCash (desktop software) . You can import the data from GnuCash, and record transactions on-the-go in the app, and later export the data into GnuCash.
			
MyLedger can also serve as a standalone personal finance app without using the GnuCash software. It tracks bank accounts, stocks, income and expenses etc. It is based on formal double-entry accounting principles. When you need the powerful features of GnuCash (like the reporting feature), you can export data as a GnuCash file and open it with GnuCash.

Features:
1. Record transactions in GnuCash-compatible, double-bookkeeping fashion.
2. Budgets. You can use it to help you plan how you intend for your finances to change over a period of time, and to examine how your actual financial transactions for the period compare to your planned transactions.
3. Import data from .gnucash file (GnuCash-compatible format), and export data to .gnucash file (GnuCash-compatible format).
