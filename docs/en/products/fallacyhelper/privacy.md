I take privacy very seriously. I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 

All data about the app (preferences, progress, etc.) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. 

This app does not collect any privacy or non-privacy information of you or your device by itself.
